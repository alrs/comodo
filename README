comodo domain verifier
----------------------

This program expects to receive a list of domains to be validated on STDIN
where each line consists of:

    domainname,md5,sha1,orderid

and it will output CSV lines as follows

    domainname,status,timestamp,orderid

The status will be one of

    OK        The domainname verified correctly
    BAD       The domainname verification failed
    ERROR     Some network error occurred (domains that get 
              this error can be retried)

The comodo program has a single parameter

    -workers  The number of worker "threads" to run to perform validation
   
    -resolver IP address of resolver (defaults to 8.8.8.8)

Example execution
-----------------

    $ cat list_of_domains_with_hashes | bin/comodo -workers=500

If a parsing error occurs (i.e. a bad line in the input file) then an error
will be output on STDERR.

Validation
----------

Validation is done based on the rules specified here:
